****************************************
* ERMAGERD, WHERE ARE MA STYLES??!?!?? *
****************************************
Styles are generated by the scss files in /library/scss/
and are compiled to here: /library/css/

Plate (and Template) uses Sass and SCSS syntax. If you don't already use Sass/SCSS you should be. Check it out here:
http://sass-lang.com
https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-sass
https://www.sitepoint.com/whats-difference-sass-scss/

To use Sass you will need a precompiler to generate your css files. I recommend CodeKit...it's super awesome:

WordPress Probz
So Theme Check (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/)
is constantly telling me that it needs these classes in the CSS even
though they are in the REAL stylesheet in library/css/style.css.
So we're gonna drop these here to keep it happy.
Great work, Theme Check (eye roll)
